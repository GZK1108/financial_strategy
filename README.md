UESTC finance : Comprehensive Curriculum Design II: Financial Trading Strategy Design and Simulation, the autumn of 2023.

I will use this repository to save my financial strategies. If there is any questions about my codes, please commit issues. 

We use JoinQuant to backtest our strategies. So the codes are written in JoinQuant environment.
